A C compiler built in Node JS


## Background

It all started with this tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An enormous virtue of plain old C is that most senior developers are capable of writing their own C compiler, and knowing your tools at that level is valuable! I would need a lot of study time to write a C++ compiler. <a href="https://t.co/WXJ45RbPZR">https://t.co/WXJ45RbPZR</a></p>&mdash; John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1078092777429311488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

Had idea...created repository...we will see...

Plan should be write some quick C samples.
Get them to compile...analyze samples to understand assembly and the structure of PE.
